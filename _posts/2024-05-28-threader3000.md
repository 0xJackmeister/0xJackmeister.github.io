So.. I was looking for a fast port scanner , and came across many different port scanner such as rustscan , masscan , zenmap but ultimately most port scanner uses almost same function as nmap.

Then I came across[ Theader3000 by Dievus](https://github.com/dievus/threader3000). In the repo he stated that  `A full port scan can take as little as 15 seconds, but at max should take less than 1 minute 30 seconds depending on your internet connection.`  

Is this black magic ? Upon reading the python3 source code here are the core functions

1. **Multi-Threading**:
   ```python
   def threader():
       while True:
          worker = q.get()
          portscan(worker)
          q.task_done()
   ```
   Here, the `threader` function is responsible for creating and managing threads. It continuously retrieves tasks from the queue (`q.get()`), where each task represents a port to scan. The `portscan` function is then called to scan the port, and once the task is completed, it signals that the task is done (`q.task_done()`). This setup allows for concurrent scanning of multiple ports using multiple threads, significantly speeding up the scanning process.

2. **Socket Connection Handling**:
   ```python
   def portscan(port):
       s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
       try:
          portx = s.connect((t_ip, port))
          with print_lock:
             print("Port {} is open".format(port))
             discovered_ports.append(str(port))
          portx.close()
       except (ConnectionRefusedError, AttributeError, OSError):
          pass
   ```
   The `portscan` function attempts to establish a connection to the target IP address (`t_ip`) on the specified port. It quickly moves on to the next port if the connection attempt fails due to connection refused, attribute errors, or OS errors. This efficient handling of socket connections ensures that the scanner doesn't waste time waiting for unresponsive ports.

3. **Port Range**:
   ```python
   for worker in range(1, 65536):
       q.put(worker)
   ```
   The scanner iterates through a wide range of ports from 1 to 65535 (`range(1, 65536)`), ensuring that it checks a large number of ports for openness. This comprehensive scanning approach contributes to the thoroughness of the scan and helps in identifying open ports quickly.

4. **Timeout Settings**:
   ```python
   socket.setdefaulttimeout(0.30)
   ```
   The default timeout for socket operations is set to 300 milliseconds (`0.30` seconds). This short timeout ensures that the scanner doesn't waste time waiting for unresponsive ports to timeout, allowing it to move on to the next port swiftly.
   
## Slight Modification

Since it requires interaction,  and I have a fondness for automation, I decided to modify the code by removing segments that require user interaction. Now, it only requires supplying the IP or domain, after which it will automatically save the Nmap `-oN` output to the current working directory.

```python
  t2 = datetime.now()
    total = t2 - t1
    print("Port scan completed in "+str(total))
    print("-" * 60)
    print("Following Nmap command will be runned:")
    print("*" * 60)
    print("nmap -p{ports} -sV -sC -T4 -Pn -oN {ip}-nmap {ip}".format(ports=",".join(discovered_ports), ip=target))
    print("*" * 60)
    nmap = "nmap -p{ports} -sV -sC -T4 -Pn -oN {ip}-nmap {ip}".format(ports=",".join(discovered_ports), ip=target)
    t3 = datetime.now()
    total1 = t3 - t1
```

### Result
```bash
threader3000.py 192.168.222.13
